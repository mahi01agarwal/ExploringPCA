# Image Compression using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This project demonstrates a basic image compression technique using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Python. It reads an input image, applies PCA to reduce its dimensionality, and then visualizes the compressed image.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `opencv-python`
- `scikit-learn` (for PCA)

You can install these libraries using `pip` if you don't have them already:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn
```

## File Structure

- `doraemon.jpg`: The input image you want to compress.
- `cat.jpg`: An example of the compressed image (you can rename it to save the compressed result).
- `Imagecompression.jpg`: An example of the compressed image generated by the script.

## How to Use

1. Place your desired input image (e.g., `doraemon.jpg`) in the same directory as this script.

2. Run the script. It will read the input image, apply PCA-based compression, and display the compressed image.

3. You can adjust the compression level by modifying the `compress` function argument. For example, `compress(10)` will compress the image using only 10% of the principal components.

## Sample Usage

Here's an example of how to use the script:

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from numpy.linalg import svd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.pyplot import imshow
import cv2

# Define the show_image function

# Load the input image (e.g., 'doraemon.jpg') and convert it to RGB
orig = cv2.imread('doraemon.jpg')
rgb_image = cv2.cvtColor(orig, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Display the original image
show_image(rgb_image)

# Perform PCA-based compression
compress(10)  # Adjust the compression percentage as needed
```

## Note

- The script will display the original image and the compressed image using PCA. You can save the compressed image for further use by renaming it (e.g., `cat.jpg`).

- Depending on the compression level, you may need to fine-tune the number of principal components used in the `compress` function to achieve the desired compression ratio.

- The script is provided as a basic example of PCA-based image compression and can be extended or modified for more advanced use cases.
